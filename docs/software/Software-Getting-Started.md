This document is a basic “what-to-install” guide to function on the software subteam.

## Links to Know (Bookmak)

#0.1: https://github.com/BitBucketsFRC4183/FRC2019_Destination_Deep_Space is the GitHub repository for this year
#0.2: https://github.com/BitBucketsFRC4183/ARTHUR is the GitHub repository for ARTHUR (software testing program - A Robot To Help Us Robot)
#0.3: https://github.com/BitBucketsFRC4183/FRC2020InfiniteRecharge/ is the GitHub repository for the upcoming season

Install #1: VS Code
VS Code is the IDE via which we program our robot
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Once downloaded, add WPILib software: https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java is the installation guide, while https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases has the installs that include VS Code (scroll down to WPILibInstaller_Windows[32/64]... .zip)

Install #2: Gitkraken
We organize our code using Git - it is important to make a GitHub account here: https://github.com/, ask Craig for permission to join Bit Buckets group so that you can make changes to the code, and to follow @sabzer 
Gitkraken is a means of visualizing uploading and changes progress, and is strongly recommended
Download here: https://www.gitkraken.com/

Install #3: CTRE Installation Guide
CTRE manufactures (most of) the motor controllers we use http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx.html#product_tabs_technical_resources
Click on installer of most recent version of CTRE software, as of June 2018 is “Phoenix”

Install #4: NI FRC Software Update Suite
Allows for radio configuration tool, RoboRIO imaging tool, and Driver Station which allows for robot connection
Link here: http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2017/7904/en/
(2019) If needed, decrypt zip with $Robots&in#SPACE!!
(2019) Serial number B04P64663

Install #5: Jaci Brunning’s PathPlanner JNI
We don’t currently use this, don’t bother installing for now until we determine we need it
Supports autonomous through path planning trajectory calculations which we then push to  CANTalons (motor controllers)
